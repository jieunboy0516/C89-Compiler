# Team042 Compilers Coursework 2023
The source of the compiler is in the `src/` directory and has been written in C++ using Flex and Bison for the lexing and parsing stage

# Tasks to be completed (very rough):
- [ ] Lexer to tokenize a single source file
- [ ] Parser for a single source file
- [ ] Compiler for a single source file
- [ ] Extend to multiple source files

# Personnel
- [HURULD](https://github.com/HURULD)  - Harry Griffiths (hng21)
